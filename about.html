            <p>
                <a href="https://medium.com/an-objective-viewpoint" target="_blank">"An Objective Viewpoint"</a> is a Medium publication dedicated to exploring how Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism 
                applies to contemporary issues, promoting critical thinking, individualism, and rational self-interest.
